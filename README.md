# GreyHatGT Work

This is my work for the applied reverse engineering meetings at the GreyHatGT Cybersecurity Club.

Lab 1: ForceAttack - A fill in the blanks program that will takes in the address of the ForceAttack command and causes you to shoot when you press the space bar.
(This was not written by me)

Lab 2: BunnyHop - A fill in the blanks program that takes in the address of the player pointer, the fFlags offset, and the ForceJump command. Holding ALT will cause you to jump immediately upon landing, allowing you to bunny hop more easily.

Lab 3: TriggerBot - A program that will immediately shoot when your cursor goes over an entity, giving you essentially 0ms reaction time if you are pre-aiming properly.
